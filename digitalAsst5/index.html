<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
To be honest, I vaguely remember seeing this game somewhere on the Internet. It was probably a game that trended
for a whilte, and this is a take on it. I am very proud to have gotten this game working.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The rotation mechanic was mathematically challenging.
The camera movement with the white circles took a while.
The whole calculation of boundaries and stuff took a lot of time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned more about using the mouse pointer and *being able to set the isDown is VERY IMPORTANT.
The camera stuff was pretty easy once I found examples. It was cool to know how to set the text relative to the camera.
The hardest part was making the game progress on and detecting game over.
The easiest part was doing basic math and text stuff.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assests were taken from <a href="https://github.com/jojoee/phaser-examples/tree/master/games/circle-path/assets">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed from the source code from <a href="https://www.emanueleferonato.com/2016/02/11/html5-prototype-of-ios-game-circle-path-made-with-phaser/">here</a>.
All of the code was in Phaser 2, so translating them over to Phaser 3 and adding/editing/removing features was a good experience.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Land the rotating colored circle inside the white circles as many times as possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The challenge I tackled: "Round and Round. Rotation is one of the primary mechanics in the game.".
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Input: Mouse</li>
        <li>Randomness: randomness</li>
        <li>Genre: Adventure?</li>
        <li>Play Style: Achiever</li>   
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I think the game mechanic this game is going for is "Reaction Speed".
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have fun and feel challenged as the game gets increasingly harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player has to land the rotating colored circle into the white targets as many times as possible 
consecutively. The player will have to click in order to stop the rotating colored circle. If the 
colored circle is not fully inside the white targets, then they lose. As they player lands more circles,
the rotation speed will increase and make the game harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game, but the player does need to need to have good eyes and reaction speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Johny and Timmy are in their own spheres connected by an axis. They can only drive one at a time, thus forcing them
to spin around each other in turns. Only the white circles are safe spots. If they so much as drive out of the border,
they will suffer from the beams of lava rising out of the ground below. Help them escape by landing on each white 
platform (circle).
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to play a short, attention-intensive reflexive game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It would probably take about 3 min to get to a point where it is inhumanly possible to land the colored circle
within the white circle. The code determines the increasing rotational speed.
</li>

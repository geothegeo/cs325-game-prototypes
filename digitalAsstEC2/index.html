<h2>Whack those Letters!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I must admit first I thought of Fruit Ninja then I thought of Whack-A-Mole as the basis for this game.
However, this game is very original in that in order to whack the letters, the player needs to whack with not only the mouse 
but also the "keyboard" in a sense. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The only real technique that took me a while to experiment was seeing how to process key.isDown and pointer.isDown at the same
time when they are embedded under conditional statements. Everythings I have done i this game is the culmination of all that 
I have learned during this Phaser journey and a lot of logic handling. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It was interesting to create sublevels in the game and only have one line of code to set a fair time limit based on the 
current level and sub level (not shown). I thought I was pretty smart to use 2D array to hold the coordinates to create
the "moles", and the corresponding letter, which also happens to be used to bind the keys.
The hardest part was just figuring an efficient system in handling the creation and deletion of the moles. At first I used
a lot of switch statements to handle the multiple appearance of moles, but then I swapped to a 2D array and everything worked out.
The easiest part was probably detecting the player's key and mouse input on the mole.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I wrote this game completely from scratch. Pretty proud of myself.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest game to mine is any Whack-A-Mole game made with Phaser I guess.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Destroy all letters that appear on the screen
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics this game is going for "Coordination" and "Reaction Timing". The player has to have good hand coordination 
as 2 inputs are needed at once, and as time available decreases, the player will have to give the inputs faster.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged as they need a decent amount of concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
This "Whack-A-Mole" game has 5 levels and 6 sub-levels (technically the last level has infinite sub-levels). Each level
represents the number of moles that will appear at the same time, and each sub-level decreases the amount of time the player
has to whack all the letters. In order to whack the letters, the player will have to click into the circle in which the lettter(s)
appear in and hold down the corresponding letter key and left mouse button (The letters will appear capitalized, but the player is
only required to press the letter key). The letter with its circle will disappear once whacked, and the player will proceed to 
the next level/sub-level once all the on screen letters are whacked. Each whacked letter is one point, and the player is trying
to score as high as possible. The game ends when the player misses any letters available to be whacked 3 times (The player is not
penalized for the wrong key press on the letters).
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game. Just have fun and be vigilant.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player has to score high enough to be able to have dinner, or else his/her Asian parents will starve them.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to have a little fun and test their keyboard familiarity and hand-eye coordination.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The timer will stop decreasing at a certain point while 5 letters appear at the same time, so if a player is really good,
he/she could probably last forever. Before that point, it could take the player only 1-5 min depending on how fast they are.

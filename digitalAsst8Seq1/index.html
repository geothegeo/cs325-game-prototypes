<h2>Stay On the Path!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I dont think I've ever seen an online game like mine, though I was recently reminded of the fair ground game
where the player has to keep the run a stick with a metal loop thought a path without having its sides touch it.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Dynamically generating the curve from the right hand side of the screen.
Calculating distance between cursor and the Spline. 
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It was interesting to shift() and push() points in order to generate the path. It took a while to get it to a 
satisfactory level. Some design decisions such as start-the-game-at-pointer-down were good implementations 
on my part. The distance calculation was pretty painful as nothing was pixel perfect.
The hardest part was figuring out how to generate the path and taking the distance from it to the cursor.
The easiest part was probably not using timer and instead kept track of time through the update() function
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I actually got some help from the Phaser Discord Server from @Golen, @photonstorm, and @Antriel. They were kind enough to 
explain to me how I should get started.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Compared to the Physical Prototype, the game is completely computerized so that there is no need for a human
moderator, although the game is not multipplayer anymore.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Do not stray too far from the line.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics this game is going for "Concentration". The player has to be steady and weary of the change in pathing.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged as they need a decent amount of concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Though not checked yet, the player should place his cursor *anywhere on the line* and click on the game in order to 
have the path start "moving". The player will have to hover (no need to hold down left click) along the path in order to
stay alive. If a distance greater than 50 units occurs, then the player dies. The player can be anywhere along the 
visible path on the screen. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game. Just have fun and expect the unexpect.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a game with the devil, the devil asks you to stay on the path to run away (you never do because the path
is infinite) or perish.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to have a little fun and test their concetration.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is no time limit. The player plays until he/she leaves the path.
</li>

<h2>Clean Your Room!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It is a collecting game that forces the user to use mouse-controlled movements under time pressure.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The mouse-controlled character movement is pretty cool.
The decreasing timer mechanic is thoughtful.
The bears and bombs have random velocities.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned about how to deal with registering the mouse pointer.
I also learned about resizing PNGs to create moving objects and mess with the physics.
Death by timer took a while to figure out, and I was satisfied with the result.
The easiest part was twiggling around with the math. The hardest part was getting
a satisfactory pointer-based movement system down and conceptualizing the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Backdrop: <a href="http://www.textures4photoshop.com/tex/brick-and-wall/room-background-for-photoshop-free.aspx">room PNG</a></li>
        <li>Bear: <a href="https://freepngimg.com/objects/toy">toy PNG</a></li>
        <li>Platforms: <i>given (resized)</i></li>
        <li>Player: <i>given</i></li>
        <li>Bombs: <i>given</i></li>
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    This game is close to the "first Phaser 3 game". The codebase I used is from <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game/part2">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect all toys in the room before time runs out.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme I tackled: "Cleaning".
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Input: Mouse</li>
        <li>Randomness: some randomness</li>
        <li>Genre: Family, Racing</li>
        <li>Play Style: Collector</li>   
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I think the game mechanic this game is going for is "Mouse Skills".
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have fun and feel challenged as the game gets increasingly harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player has to click and hold on the screen in order to make the character move continuously.
If the cursor is aimed above the character, the character will jump if it is on the ground.
If the cursor is level or below the character, the character will simply move in the direction
of the pointer. When you touch the bears, you will collect them. Once all the bears are gone,
the timer will be reset and shortened by 3 seconds (to a min of 20 sec), an additional bear will be added,
and an additional bomb will be added. If the timer runs out or you touch a bomb, then the game ends.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game, but the player does need to get used to the character movement.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Little Johny needs to clean up his room after playing all day or else his parents will punish him.
Each day he plays with more toys (safe and dangerous ones), and he is trying to maintain a streak of 
not getting caught.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to play a short, time-intensive arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It would probably take about 5 min to finish the game. At a certain point, there will be
too many bears to collect and too many bombs flying around to prevent you from finishing
in 20 seconds.
</li>

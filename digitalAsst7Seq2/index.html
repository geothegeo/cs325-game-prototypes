<h2>Slap Interval v2</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My inspiration is drawn from Slap Jack, but honestly, I don't think I have ever seen a game where the player has to keep track
of the order of the cards and slap in accordance to previously displayed cards. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Creating a form to take in user input.
Using events on objects (GameObjects and Form) as opposed to pointer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Changing the form with desired HTML elements took a while. Styling took a lot longer. The JS code took the longest.
I initially also had trouble showing the form. Had to use the Phaser 3 sandbox to get it working.
There was incorrect game logic I had to fix (listed below). Switching from pointer.down to gameobjectdown
in update() was a proud move to avoid "accidental" clicks away from the card.
The hardest part was figuring out how to juggle between contexts (form and game).
The easiest part was probably the formatting and setting up the card example form Phaser 3.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assests (cards.png and cards.json) were taken from <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/atlas">here</a>.
<br>Form template taken from <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/blob/master/public/assets/text/loginform.html">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Improvements made: <br>
<ol>
    <li>*User inputs for card display interval and "card interval"</li>
    <li>*The game will keep regenerating until at least 3 hits are possible</li>
    <li>*Only clicks on cards will register now (changed from pointer.isdown -> this.input.on('gameobjectdown' ...)</li>
    <li>*Improved game logic (also applied to v1): mishit and score now tracked seperately, reset arrays = [] in while loop</li>
    <li>Improved game messages: Show number of cards left in deck, Congratulate user if they slapped all possible hits</li>
    <li>aesthetic tweeks</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Tap a card if you have seen it before, the seen-it-before-distance is defined by the "Card Interval".
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics this game is going for are "Memorization". Now the user can customize the setting to challenged themselves.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged as they need a decent amount of concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game shows a standard deck of 52 cards. After every Card-Display seconds, the top card will be removed to show the next card.
The ony interaction the player has is clicking on the card (multiple clicks will only register once). There is a custom "card interval", n, 
which indicated the number of cards that must be passed in order for the player to have an opportunity to score. 
The scoring condition is that the card before the n cards and the card after must be the same. For example, if the first and fifth card are the same,
then by tapping on the fifth card, the player will be able to score a point. While keeping track of the first card (for the unseen fifth card), 
the second card might have a match with the unseen sixth card, so the player will also have to keep that in mind. The game will tell the player
how many matches there are beforehand to make the game "easier" in a sense. The games when either the player mistaps 3 times or the deck runs though all the cards.
In the latter case, the player will be told how many slaps they were able to tap out of the total possible hits.  
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game, but the player does need to have good short term memory and a bit of reaction speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a game with the devil, the devil asks you to get all the possible hits otherwise you will suffer a terrible fate.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to improve/test their memory. The game could also just be for fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Assuming the player does not lose early on, it could take anywhere between 52 seconds (52 cards * 1 seconds) to 260 seconds (52 cards * 5 seconds). 
The time is based on what the user has selected for the Display Interval.

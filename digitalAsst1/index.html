<h2>Block Snake</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
It's a classic Snake game with a randomly spawning obstacle, and you can move past the borders.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The visual and audio elements are on point. The random spawning "blocks" are pretty interesting.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned a lot of the basics in dealing with Phaser 3. There was a lot to learn and consider when giving each
element in the game a class and properties. I also gained insight into adding images, music, movement, randomness,
and object collision. The hardest part by far was probably figuring out how the objects should interact with each other.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Snake body: <a href="https://www.cleanpng.com/png-black-square-computer-icons-clip-art-1687034/download-png.html">Black Square PNG</a></li>
        <li>Food: <a href="https://pngimg.com/image/12405">Apple PNG</a></li>
        <li>Obstacle: <a href="http://clipart-library.com/clipart/73919.htm">Brick Cliparts #37174</a></li>
        <li>Background Music: <a href="https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/downloads-c/happy-music/2">"Happy Dreams" MP3</a></li>
        <li>Biting Sound Effect: <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/?s=eat&post_type=music&sound-effect-category-id=">"Bite into apple 1" MP3</a></li>
        <li>Dying Sound Effect: <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/page/3/?s=death&post_type=music&sound-effect-category-id">
            "Retro 8-bit arcade style game sound, negative, death, die or lose life 3" MP3</a></li>       
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is close to the classic Nokia Snake game. The codebase I used is from <a href="https://phaser.io/phaser3/devlog/85">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Collect apples and grow in size until there are no more apples to collect.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme/Challenge:</strong>
The challenge I tackled: "Things must only be added as the game progresses, not removed".
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
    <ul>
        <li>Input: keyboard</li>
        <li>Randomness: some randomness</li>
        <li>Genre: Family, Puzzle</li>
        <li>Play Style: Collector</li>   
    </ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
I think the game mechanic this game is going for is "Movement".
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to have fun and be on their toes as the game gets increasingly harder.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can only use arrow keys to move: left (left arrow), right (right arrow), 
up (up arrow), and down (down arrow). The player will need to try to eat as many apples as possible
while avoiding the random bricks. The catch is the more apples the player eats, the faster the snake
will move, so the person must be very quick-witted when moving around on the board.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game, but the player does need to have good dexterity and reaction times.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is really not any story or setting that made the game what it is. Maybe the snake got hungry
and he needed to eat apples, but in reality, life is not easy and his body is cursed to grow very fast 
as he ate.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to play a short arcade game.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
It would probably take about 10 min to finish the game if you are lucky.
</li>

<h2>Slap Interval</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My inspiration is drawn from Slap Jack, but honestly, I don't think I have ever seen a game where the player has to keep track
of the order of the cards and slap in accordance to previously displayed cards. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Creating the card stack (laid on top of each other)
Card tween based on a timer
Creating a lot of arrays to keep track of order, scoring, etc.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
Coordinating the card animation based on time took up quite a while. 
The other thing that took up a lot of time was creating arrays based on the shuffled deck and setting all the values needed for the game logic.
The hardest part was making the game progress on and detecting game over.
The easiest part was probably the formatting and setting up the card example form Phaser 3.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assests (cards.png and cards.json) were taken from <a href="https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-examples/tree/master/public/assets/atlas">here</a>.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Compared to the Physical Prototype, this digital version is not multiplier. The improved freatures include the automatic shuffling of the deck,
a timer that can control the rate at which cards are shown, and a way to keep track if the slaps are right or not.
<br/>I borrowed the source code from <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v3/view/input/pointer/cards">here</a>.
It wasn't much of a game. It was just an example showing the usage of cards and applying tweens to them.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Tap a card if you have seen it before, the seen-it-before-distance is defined by the "Card Interval".
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics this game is going for are "Memorization".
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged as they need a decent amount of concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game shows a standard deck of 52 cards. After every 2 seconds, the top card will be removed to show the next card.
The ony interaction the player has is clicking on the card (multiple clicks will only register once). There is a "card interval"
that has been set to 3, which indicated the number of cards that must be passed in order for the player to have an opportunity to score. 
The scoring condition is that the card before the 3 cards and the card after must be the same. For example, if the first and fifth card are the same,
then by tapping on the fifth card, the player will be able to score a point. While keeping track of the first card (for the unseen fifth card), 
the second card might have a match with the unseen sixth card, so the player will also have to keep that in mind. The game will tell the player
how many matches there are beforehand to make the game "easier" in a sense. The games when either the player mistaps 3 times or the deck runs though all the cards.
In the latter case, the player will be told how many slaps they were able to tap out of the total possible hits.  
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game, but the player does need to have good short term memory and a bit of reaction speed.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a game with the devil, the devil asks you to get all the possible hits under his 2 second + 3 card-interval settings otherwise you will suffer a terrible fate.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to improve/test their memory. The game could also just be for fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Based on the settings for the game and assuming the player does not lose early on, it would take 106 seconds (52 cards * 2 seconds) or &#60;2 min, to play. 
</li>

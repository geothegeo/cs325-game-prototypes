<h2>Stay On the Path!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I dont think I've ever seen an online game like mine, though I was recently reminded of the fair ground game
where the player has to run a stick with a metal loop through a path without having its sides touch it.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Dynamically generating the curve from the right hand side of the screen.
Calculating distance between cursor and the Spline. 
(NEW) -> Resetting the game and keeping track of high score with local storage.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
It was interesting to shift() and push() points in order to generate the path. It took a while to get it to a 
satisfactory level. Some design decisions such as start-the-game-at-pointer-down were good implementations 
on my part. The distance calculation was pretty painful as nothing was pixel perfect.
The hardest part was calculating distance between cursor and the nearest point to the pline.
The easiest part was probably not using timer and instead kept track of time through the update() function. 
(NEW) -> hardest part was resetting the game correctly throught variables as opposed to killing the game. 
easiest part was improving "usability" features.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I actually got some help from the Phaser Discord Server from @Golen, @photonstorm, and @Antriel. They were kind enough to 
explain to me how I should get started.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
    Improvements made: <br>
    <ol>
        <li>**Changed from keeping track of seconds to just score. I was keeping track of the update() ticks, and the value
            is not the number of seconds. That's a mistake made on the past game.
        </li>
        <li>**A wall of death creeping from behind (will stop growing when it reaches 3/4 of the screen)</li>
        <li>*A "start" screen with a landing circle to start the game</li>
        <li>*Save user high score and compare to previous attempts</li>
        <li>*Game can be "restarted" by clicking on the landing circle that now reappears on gameover "screen"</li>
        <li>The distance from cursor to curve now also decreases along with the increasing speed (every 1000 seconds)</li>
        <li>Improved game messages</li>
        <li>Changing background color (turquoise gradient palette)</li>
        <li>Looping game music</li>
    </ol>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Do not stray too far from the line.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
N/A
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The game mechanics this game is going for "Concentration". The player has to be steady and weary of the change in pathing.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want the player to feel challenged as they need a decent amount of concentration.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player should place his cursor in the red circle and click on the game in order to 
have the path start "moving". The player will have to hover (no need to hold down left click) along the path in order to
stay alive. If a distance greater than the listed "Max Dist" occurs, then the player dies. The player can be anywhere along the 
visible path on the screen. He/she is not limited to being in the beginning or the end. Howerver, there is a wall of death 
pursuing from behind, and touching it will mean death.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
There is no real strategy to this game. Just have fun and expect the unexpect.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
In a game with the devil, the devil asks you to stay on the path to run away (you never do because the path
is infinite) or perish.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anyone who wants to have a little fun and test their concetration.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
There is no time limit. The player plays until he/she leaves the path.
</li>
